# ipparts
Intellectual Property Parts will be traded as ERC20 Ethereum tokens
or as other tokens on another blockchain. Refer to Wiki.
This first attempt at forming tokens is for ERC20. Need help
at https://runkit.com/mdpienaar/ipparts if it is the right place
to start. Ipparts will be a technology available
for free (mahala), to anyone
who wants to monetize their assets i.e. copyrights, goodwill,
trademarks etc, which may not be recorded on balance sheets according
to International Accounting Standards.
