# ipparts
Background: According to International Accounting Standards, Intellectual
Property may not be recorded on balance sheets. It is partly the cause for
differences between market capitalization of shares and equity values on balance sheets.
In my view the origin of the accounting standards relates much to
philosophical and religious convictions whereby "the Creator who forms" new
ideas, "is" sacrificed. The capital of new ideas has been and currently is,
subject to the use of "intelligence". Consequentially it is very difficult
for creative people to monetize their ideas. Ideas are common property and
free to appropriate. Imparting of ideas is protected in secular Constitutions
and Labour Law. During the Enlightenment philosophers motivated rights to
salaries and wages, but they did not motivate rights to ideas generated.
Generating ideas is the first step of improvement, before labour develops ideas. If people who have easy
access to money also have easy access to new ideas, they can easily employ
the necessary labour and buy necessary natural resources to develop valuable
new ideas, whilst excluding the ones who generated the ideas. Refer to the Wiki
for more background information: https://github.com/mdpienaar/ipparts/wiki |||||
Proposal: The proposal herewith is to form an exchange exclusively for
Intellectual Property Parts (ipparts). According to the plan creative people
who need finance to develop their ideas will sell ipparts in their goodwill, copyrights,
and other intellectual property, which may not be capitalized on balance sheets, unless it is sold.
Ipparts will be traded as ERC20 Ethereum tokens or as other tokens on another
blockchain.||||| Currently Africahead is busy with an over the counter ITO of Africahead Ipparts (AFA), at
https://www.africahead.co.za/Africahead/RaisingCapital.html. AFA was the first brand token and is backed by 48% of the
Africahead brand-value/goodwill/copyrights. Refer to the white paper.
Other brand tokens have also been listed and can be bought with ETH and Moyom (MYM), the utility token of Ipparts
Exchange (IPPAEX), on Ledgerdex.com currently. The purpose of the ITOs is raising funds for expansion
of the Africahead business and implementation of different projects, which will include new websites. After the ITOs
raised new
capital I want to develop an own exchange platform on which the brand tokens will trade at least, against MYM.
The following webpages and Github websites are particularly relevant:
https://www.africahead.co.za/Africahead/IppartsExchange.html & https://www.africahead.co.za/Africahead/Moyom.html &
https://africahead.github.io & https://dividedparty.github.io & https://fonetones.github.io &
https://kaeuoi.github.io.
I have to sell equity currently in Africahead to raise capital for the project. A proposal for a private placing of
equity can be read at: https://www.africahead.co.za/indexfiles/SignedPrivatePlacingProposal.pdf.
